This website is Lauren Zanini's personal CV / resume. This README file will document the code of Project 02, and explain the JavaScript / jQuery features implemented. This file will also reference all sources used to create the code.

### *Template*
I got my template from [Html5up](https://html5up.net/) and it was called **halcyonic**, it had multiple pages but I deleted the code of what I did and did not want to get the template I currently have. I used one of the **Two-Column pages** that came with the template, and changed that file to **index.html**. I also had to delete the other pages, the navigation bar, and change things in main.js and main.css such as sizing, font and layout. I uploaded this template with help from this website: [Moving Folders From Desktop to Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/591498/moving-a-folder-from-desktop-to-the-server)

### *JS Feature 01*
My first custom JS feature allows the user to change the colour of the webpage background. I found code from the following websites to help me implement this feature. This feature had HTML, and JS code. The **HTML** is located in **index.html**, and the **JS** is located in **bgcolourchange.js**. I used code referenced below, as well as code from the lab and lecture slides posted to our class website, and I styled them to match my theme, fonts and personal preference. I also chose a pastel colour scheme and found the colour names from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hex.asp). 
Websites:

### *Icons*
In my contact information I added **Font-Awesome Icons**, I used the following sites to do so:
[w3schools FA Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp)
[GitHub FA](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11946)
[w3schools FA writing](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_icons_writing.asp)

### *Lists and Images*
I got help from w3schools for lists and images as well:
[w3schools  Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp)
[w3schools Images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)

### *JS Feature 02*
For my last custom JS feature, I decided to make an animated skills bar to showcase my hard skills. This feature had HTML, CSS and JS code. The **HTML** code can be found in **index.html**, the **CSS** code can be found in **main.css** and the **JS** code can be found in **skillbar.js**. I styled the code to match my theme and font, and I added the hard skills that I would like to show on my resume, I also chose colours for the individual bars using the color-picker. The following websites were used to construct this code:
[Codepen Skillbar](https://codepen.io/tamak/pen/hzEer)
[w3lessons Skill-bar](https://w3lessons.info/skill-bar-with-jquery-css3/)

### *Final Note*
