### *Lauren Zanini (Mac-ID: zaninil)*
#### Overview
This website is Lauren Zanini's personal CV / resume. This README file will document the code of Project 02, and explain the JavaScript / jQuery features implemented. This file will also reference all sources used to create the code.

### *Template*
I got my template from [Html5up](https://html5up.net/) and it was called **halcyonic**, it had multiple pages but I deleted the code of what I did and did not want to get the template I currently have. I uploaded this template with help from this website: [Moving Folders From Desktop to Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/591498/moving-a-folder-from-desktop-to-the-server)

### *JS Feature 01*
My first custom JS feature allows the user to change the colour of the webpage background. I found code from the following websites to help me implement this feature. This feature had HTML, and JS code. The **HTML** is located in **index.html**, and the **JS** is located in **bgcolourchange.js**. I also chose a pastel colour scheme and found the colour names from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hex.asp). 
Websites:
[How to Change Background Colour Using JS](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-change-the-background-color-of-a-web-page-using-javascript.php)
[Allow User to Change Background](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53787686/allow-user-to-change-background-colour-in-javascript)

### *Icons*
In my contact information I added **Font-Awesome Icons**, I used the following sites to do so:
[w3schools FA Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp)
[GitHub FA](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11946)
[w3schools FA writing](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_icons_writing.asp)

### *Lists and Images*
I got help from w3schools for lists and images as well:
[w3schools  Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp)
[w3schools Images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)

### *JS Feature 02*
My last custom JS feature, I decided to make an animated skills bar to showcase my hard skills. This feature had HTML, CSS and JS code. The **HTML** code can be found in **index.html**, the **CSS** code can be found in **main.css** and the **JS** code can be found in **skillbar.js**. I got this feature to work and then however I may have accidentally deleted a portion of my code that was crucial to this feature, and now the animated skills bar only completes its animation when the webpage is not in fullscreen. The animation works when the browser is open but not in fullscreen mode. I am usure what I deleted to cause this issue. The following websites were used to construct this code:
[Codepen Skillbar](https://codepen.io/tamak/pen/hzEer)
[w3lessons Skill-bar](https://w3lessons.info/skill-bar-with-jquery-css3/)
